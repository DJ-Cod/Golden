  <p> You pick the golden door, and as you walk through it you close your eyes and are filled with warmth. </p>
  <p> As you open your eyes, the door quickly shuts behind you with a solid *bang, and you turn around to see that a tall, skinny figure has shut it. </p> 
  <p> They step forwards, and you can clearly see his face with a friendly smile. He seems nice, and he tells you that his name is Matt. </p>
  <p> "I've actually been down here for 40 years, ya'know. Haven't aged a bit." You notice that he has a slight british accent, and he seems to be genuine. </p>
  <p> You try questioning him about it and he just keeps changing the subject, so you just give up. He then leads you down what seems to be an old abandoned library, with dusty books scattered here and there. You pick one up and he stares into your eyes with a glare. </p>
  <p> "You CANNOT do that, ya'know." You tentatively put the book down and the two of you keep walking, as he keeps rambling on about unimportant subjects. </p>
  <p> As he keeps talking, you can sense that he is very nervous, and can sense that you have the speed that you do, even though you were trying to supress it as you came in. </p>
  <p> However, as the two of you kep walking, you see the same books over and over again. </p>
  <p> As you come to a cold stop, you try to ask him why it seems to be looping, but he immediately tells you to get quiet, and as you look ahead, you can see a ball of light moving through the bookcases. As it passes, you forget your question and just ask what it was. </p>
  <p> "I don't know," he says, "I could just feel an evil prescence, so I tried to avoid it." </p>
  <p> You finally get around to asking him why it seems you two are looping, and he simply answers with: "Oh. Sorry, taht happens when I'm nervous. You see, I haven't done this in a while, so I've gotten a little performance anxiety." </p>
  <p> You insantly notice that it seems like you are moving forwards again, and then you two come to a huge door. It is huge: 16 feet tall and 4 feet wide. It is crimson purple and has a huge cow head right in the middle of it, also purple. It has red gems for eyes and a golden nose loop. </p>
